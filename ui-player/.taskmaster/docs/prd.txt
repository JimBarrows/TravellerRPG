# Traveller RPG Player UI - Authentication System Completion

## Project Overview
Complete the User Authentication System for the Traveller RPG Player UI application. The system currently has basic authentication components (LoginForm, RegistrationForm, AuthContext) with AWS Amplify/Cognito integration. We need to complete the remaining authentication features to provide a full-featured user management system.

## Background & Context
- Frontend: React with Vite
- Authentication: AWS Amplify with Cognito
- Testing: Vitest for unit tests, Cucumber for BDD
- Current Implementation: Basic login/registration forms and auth context exist
- Infrastructure: AWS CDK for backend infrastructure

## Product Requirements

### Task 2.4: Complete User Registration and Login Flows with Backend Integration
**Priority: High**
**Complexity: Medium**

**User Stories:**
- As a new user, I want to register with email verification so that my account is secure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Email verification flow works end-to-end
- Password strength validation during registration
- User can choose to stay logged in (remember me)
- Clear error messages for all authentication failures
- Loading states for all async operations
- Automatic redirect after successful authentication
- Session persistence across browser refreshes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Integrate with existing AWS Cognito user pool
- Handle all Cognito authentication states
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Add comprehensive BDD tests for authentication flows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Profile page displays current user information
- Users can edit name, email, and other profile attributes
- Avatar upload with image preview and crop functionality
- Images uploaded to S3 with proper CDN access

- Add image processing (resize, crop, format validation)
- Integrate with AWS Amplify Storage
- Add profile photo to user context
- Create reusable avatar display component

### Task 2.6: Complete JWT Token Management with Refresh Mechanisms
**Priority: High**
**Complexity: Medium**

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want my session to automatically refresh so I don't get logged out unexpectedly
- As a developer, I want secure token handling to protect user data
- As a user, I want to be notified before my session expires

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Graceful handling of expired tokens
- Session timeout warnings
- Secure token storage (HttpOnly cookies where possible)
- Logout on token refresh failure
- Background token refresh without UI interruption

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement token refresh interceptor
- Add session timeout detection
- Create token expiration warning system
- Handle network failures during token refresh
- Add token validation middleware
- Implement secure token storage strategy

### Task 2.7: Implement Account Management with Deletion, Data Export, and Subscription Tiers
**Priority: Medium**
**Complexity: High**

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to delete my account and all associated data
- As a user, I want to export my data before account deletion
- As a user, I want to upgrade/downgrade my subscription tier
- As a user, I want to see what features are available in each tier

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Account deletion with confirmation workflow
- Data export functionality (JSON format)
- Subscription tier management (Free, Standard, Premium)
- Feature access controls based on subscription tier
- Clear communication of tier benefits and limitations
- Billing integration for paid tiers
- Data retention policy compliance

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create AccountSettings component
- Implement data export service
- Add subscription tier management
- Create feature flag system based on user tier
- Implement account deletion workflow
- Add GDPR compliance features
- Integrate with payment processing

### Task 2.8: Implement Social Login (Google, Apple) and MFA Support
**Priority: Medium**
**Complexity: High**

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account for convenience
- As a user, I want to sign in with my Apple account for privacy
- As a user, I want to enable two-factor authentication for security
- As a user, I want to manage my MFA settings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Google OAuth integration working end-to-end
- Apple Sign In integration working end-to-end
- TOTP-based MFA with QR code setup
- MFA backup codes generation and management
- MFA required for sensitive operations
- Social account linking with existing accounts
- Clear onboarding flow for MFA setup

**Technical Requirements:**
- Configure OAuth providers in Cognito
- Implement social login buttons and flows
- Add MFA setup and verification components
- Create backup codes management system
- Implement conditional MFA requirements
- Add social account management in profile

## Implementation Approach

### Development Methodology
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Write Cucumber scenarios first for all user-facing features
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write unit tests before implementation code
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Use ubiquitous language in auth domain (User, Session, Credentials, etc.)

### Testing Strategy
1. **BDD Scenarios**: Complete user authentication journeys
2. **Unit Tests**: Individual component and service testing
3. **Integration Tests**: AWS service integration testing
4. **E2E Tests**: Full authentication flows with real backend

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing AWS Cognito setup
- Compatible with React 19 and Vite
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility with current auth system

### Security Requirements
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Proper CSRF protection
- Secure token handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Audit logging for security events

## Definition of Done
- All BDD scenarios pass
- Unit test coverage > 90%
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Manual testing completed for all flows
- Documentation updated
- Code review completed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility requirements satisfied

## Success Metrics
- User registration completion rate > 90%
- Login success rate > 98%
- Session timeout incidents < 1%
- Support tickets related to auth < 5% of total
- MFA adoption rate > 30%
- Social login usage > 25%

## Technical Dependencies
